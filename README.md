The challenge consisted of:
Determine key statistical data about the month of June.
Determine key statistical data about the month of December.
Compare your findings between the month of June and December.
Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.
Share your findings in the Jupyter Notebook.

What I found interesting was that it doesnt matter what time of the month, hawaii as a place to travel still has high visitation but
more in the winter months that the summe months.
